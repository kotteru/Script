### EXT. BUS STOP - AFTERNOON HAZE

_A city bus idles at the stop. The doors close with a hiss._

_Establishing shot : The community college building towers before KYLE - pans down to shoulder level. A few other students pass by, heading home for the day._


### INT. EMPTY ELEVATOR

(wide shot)
_KYLE tapping frantically as he waits for his turn to step out._
_Walks out of the lift, towards the entrance, pulls open the glass door, and enters._

__________________________
### INT. COLLEGE HALLWAY

_The halls are quiet, mostly empty almost sanitary. Fluorescent lights hum overhead._
_Kyle walks past glass classroom doors with students eagerly listening in their class, passes by a bulletin board covered in flyers, looking for his classroom._

_He turns a corner, heading towards said room_



### INT. KYLE'S CLASSROOM - NOON

_The Classroom is dimly lit by natural light and the glow of a laptop screen. Energy drink cans and crumpled papers litter the desk._

_KYLE, disheveled in his favorite varsity jacket and sweatpants, sits at his desk. Headphones hanging by the neck, Palms supporting the weight of his head as he dozes off._

**Muffled music playing in the background**

_Head bobbing then droops forward suddenly_

**KYLE**  
_(jolting awake)_

_He blinks rapidly, disoriented. Rubs his face. Checks his phone: 11:47 AM._

_Panic floods his expression._

_He frantically clicks on his laptop, navigating to the student portal. The browser loads slowly. He drums his fingers anxiously on the desk._

_The portal opens._

**EXTREME CLOSE-UP: THE SCREEN**
**(Music starts playing unmuffled)**

**"VIDEO ASSESSMENT - FINAL PROJECT"**  
**DUE: 13/11/2025 1:00pm**  
**STATUS: NOT SUBMITTED**

_Kyle's breathing quickens._

**CLOSE-UP: KYLE'S FACE**

_His eyes widen. He runs one hand ruffling his hair._

_Kyle scrambles to open his video editing software. He clicks through folders frantically, searching for his project file._

_Files flash by: "Video_Final_v1.mp4", "Video_Final_v2.mp4", "Video_Final_FINAL.mp4", "Video_Final_ACTUAL_FINAL.mp4"_

_He clicks on the latest file. The video loads._

_His face falls. It's incomplete. Raw footage with no edits._

_Kyle is asleep at his desk, palms supporting his cheeks - THE EXACT SAME POSITION from the opening._
